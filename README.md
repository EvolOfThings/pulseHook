# PulseCheckLiquidityHook üåä

A Uniswap v4 Hook that implements dynamic liquidity management based on pool activity and social factors. This hook introduces the concept of "Rizz Factor" - a social scoring mechanism that influences liquidity positions based on trading activity and time-based factors. Deployed on Unichain, a Uniswap v4 focused L2 chain.

## Architecture üìê

## Features üöÄ

- **Dynamic Liquidity Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts liquidity positions based on:
  - Daily trading volume
  - Time-based "Rizz Factor"
  - Pool activity metrics within specific price ranges (ticks)

- **Social Incentives**: 
  - Rewards active liquidity providers with increased positions
  - Penalizes inactive positions in low-volume periods
  - Daily "Rizz Factor" updates
  - Position tracking across price ranges (each tick represents a 0.01% price change)

- **Position Tracking**:
  - Detailed tracking of user LP positions with tick ranges
  - Volume monitoring per pool
  - Timestamp-based updates

## How It Works üîÑ

### Price Ranges and Ticks
- In Uniswap v4, liquidity is provided within specific price ranges
- Each tick represents a 0.01% price change
- Users specify their position's tick range (e.g., -60 to +60 ticks = approximately ¬±0.6% price range)
- Smaller tick ranges concentrate liquidity but may require more frequent rebalancing

### Rizz Factor System
- Fixed daily Rizz Factor (currently set to hardcoded value of 33)
- Positions are updated every 24 hours (this can be adjusted in the future)
- Rizz Factor is an indicator of the social activity of a liquidity provider
- Liquidity adjustments:
  - +10% if positive interest and increased volume
  - -10% if negative interest and no volume increase

### Hook Implementation
The hook implements the following Uniswap v4 callbacks:
- `beforeAddLiquidity`: Checks position updates before adding liquidity within specified tick ranges
- `beforeRemoveLiquidity`: Validates position changes before removing liquidity from tick ranges
- `beforeSwap`: Updates positions based on trading activity within relevant ticks
- `afterSwap`: Records volume data and updates Rizz Factor based on tick-range activity

Each interaction triggers position updates and volume tracking within the specified tick ranges.
